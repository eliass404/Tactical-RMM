eliass404: how i can run this rmm localy without domain and give me all the steps i need to run it without problems or bugs 

GitHub Copilot: To run Tactical RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management) locally without a domain, you need to set up its backend (Django API), frontend, and supporting services (like NATS, MeshCentral, etc.) on your machine. Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for local development and testing, without a domain:

---

### 1. Prerequisites

- **OS:** Windows (but Tactical RMM is best run on Linux; for Windows, use WSL2 or Docker)
- **Python:** 3.10+ (for Django backend)
- **Node.js & npm:** (for frontend)
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** (recommended for services)
- **Git:** (to clone the repo)
- **Go:** (for natsapi if you want to build it yourself)

---

### 2. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm.git
cd tacticalrmm
```

---

### 3. Backend Setup (Django API)

#### a. Create a Python Virtual Environment

```powershell
cd api\tacticalrmm
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### b. Install Python Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

#### c. Run Migrations & Create Superuser

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### d. Run the Django Development Server

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

- The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

---

### 4. Frontend Setup

The frontend is a separate project (usually in a different repo: [tacticalrmm-web](https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm-web)). If you have it:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm-web.git
cd tacticalrmm-web
npm install
npm run serve
```

- The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080/` (or similar).

---

### 5. Supporting Services (Docker)

From the `docker` directory in the main repo:

```powershell
cd ..\..\docker
docker-compose up
```

- This will start NATS, MeshCentral, and other required services.

---

### 6. Configuration for Local Use (No Domain)

- In your `.env` or settings files, set all URLs to use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.
- For Django, in `settings.py`, set:
  ```python
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']
  ```
- For the frontend, set API endpoints to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

---

### 7. Access the App

- Open the frontend in your browser.
- Log in with the superuser credentials you created.

---

### 8. Troubleshooting

- If you get CORS errors, adjust Django CORS settings in `settings.py`:
  ```python
  CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True
  ```
- Make sure all services (API, frontend, Docker containers) are running.
- Check logs for errors and ensure ports are not blocked by firewalls.

---

### 9. Optional: Use Docker for Everything

You can use Docker Compose to run the entire stack (backend, frontend, services) for easier setup. See the `docker/README.md` for details.

eliass404: i want to installed on the docker , so give me step by step to do it

Workspace: Sorry, I can only assist with proposing a filetree directory structure for your project.

eliass404: docker 

Workspace: Sorry, I don't know how to set up a docker project.

eliass404: i want to installed on the docker , so give me step by step to do it

Workspace: Sorry, I can only assist with filetree directory structures.

eliass404: give location for this file ettings.py,

GitHub Copilot: The `settings.py` file for Tactical RMM (Django backend) is typically located at:

```
tacticalrmm/api/tacticalrmm/settings.py
```

**Full path from your project root:**
```
c:\Users\DPG\Desktop\project_RMM\tacticalrmm\api\tacticalrmm\settings.py
```

This is the main Django settings file where you configure things like `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, database settings, and more.

eliass404: so i add this "ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']" 

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you should add the following line to your `settings.py` file to allow local access:

````python
# ...existing code...
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']
# ...existing code...
````

Place it near the other settings (usually after `INSTALLED_APPS` or wherever `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is defined). This will let Django accept requests from your local machine.

eliass404: 

"  ALLOWED_HOSTS = []
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["api.example.com"]
    TRMM_ROOT_DOMAIN = get_root_domain(ALLOWED_HOSTS[0])
    ALLOWED_HOSTS.append(frontend_domain)
        ALLOWED_HOSTS.append("*")
    backend_url = get_backend_url(ALLOWED_HOSTS[0], TRMM_PROTO, TRMM_BACKEND_PORT) "can you updated version 

GitHub Copilot: Certainly! Here’s a revised version for local development, allowing both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, and making sure the logic is clear and safe for local use:

````python
# ...existing code...

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]

# If you have a frontend domain for local development, add it here
frontend_domain = "localhost"  # or use your actual frontend domain if different
if frontend_domain not in ALLOWED_HOSTS:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS.append(frontend_domain)

# For local development, you can use the first allowed host as the root domain
def get_root_domain(host):
    # Example implementation, adjust as needed
    return host

TRMM_ROOT_DOMAIN = get_root_domain(ALLOWED_HOSTS[0])

# If you want to allow all hosts (not recommended for production), uncomment the next line:
# ALLOWED_HOSTS.append("*")

# Example backend URL construction
TRMM_PROTO = "http"
TRMM_BACKEND_PORT = "8000"
def get_backend_url(host, proto, port):
    return f"{proto}://{host}:{port}"

backend_url = get_backend_url(ALLOWED_HOSTS[0], TRMM_PROTO, TRMM_BACKEND_PORT)

# ...existing code...
````

**Notes:**
- Only use `ALLOWED_HOSTS.append("*")` for testing; never in production.
- Adjust `frontend_domain` if your frontend runs on a different host/port.
- Make sure `get_root_domain` and `get_backend_url` are defined as needed for your project.

Let me know if you need this tailored further!

eliass404: and what about this part "CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = ["https://rmm.example.com"]  "

GitHub Copilot: For local development, you should update `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` to allow your frontend’s local address. For example:

````python
# ...existing code...
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [
    "http://localhost:8080",      # if your frontend runs on port 8080
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080",      # optional, for 127.0.0.1
]
# ...existing code...
````

**Tip:**  
If you want to allow all origins during development (not recommended for production), you can use:

````python
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True
````

But for better security, specify only the origins you need.
